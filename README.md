# 👋 Hi there, I'm Jeongmin!

I'm a university student with a **deep passion** for systems programming and Bitcoin.  
I’m particularly interested in LoRa communication, the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and modern frontend web development.  
Currently, I’m studying the inner workings of the Bitcoin protocol through *Programming Bitcoin* by Jimmy Song.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- 📡 **LoRa Communication Optimization**
  - Exploring ways to improve the quality of communication in LoRa networks.
  - Researching how machine learning and lossy compression can enhance data transmission in constrained environments.

- 📘 **Studying the Bitcoin Protocol**
  - Working through *Programming Bitcoin* to learn how Bitcoin works from the ground up.
  - Gaining a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s mechanics to apply the knowledge in real-world projects.

- 🌐 **OpenPleb Website Development**
  - Building a community-driven Bitcoin website.
  - Using **TailwindCSS** and **TypeScript** to create a responsive and modern UI/UX experience.
